# Glasper

---

Named after Robert Glasper, Glasper is supposed to be a fun little program to help generate tasty neo-soul 
chord progressions without actually knowing how to play piano.

The idea is that I want to have backing tracks to play along to, but since I don't know how to play piano
very well, and because I don't want to spend money on any backing tracks, I could use this.

All you have to do is plug in a midi piano controller into your computer, start the software, and you can select
which types of chords you want to play, then just play the root note of that chord and Glasper will take care of the rest.

The idea is that you can switch between chord types using an actual typing keyboard on one hand, and play the roots of the chords with the other hand so that you can play the chord progressions in one go without having to re-record.

Once you record your track, you can export it to MIDI, and then open it up in a DAW like Logic Pro and use your VSTs to put a realistic instrument on it and then do whatever else you want to do.
